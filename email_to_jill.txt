Subject: HBA Foundation Scholarship Database - Prototype Ready for Review

Hi Jill,

Thank you for reaching out about the scholarship research project for the Afghan students. I completely understand the challenges they're facing with accessing educational opportunities, and I'm excited to share what I've developed based on your vision.

I've created a comprehensive scholarship database prototype specifically designed for the HBA Foundation and your students at Mawoud. The website addresses exactly what you described - a centralized, private platform to store and organize scholarship information for Afghan students seeking opportunities abroad.

**Website Link:** https://hba-foundation-igz48y62s-mikezenkos-projects.vercel.app

## Key Features:

**Public Interface:**
- Interactive scholarship explorer with 7 pre-researched scholarships
- Advanced filtering by country, funding type, and education level
- Detailed scholarship information including deadlines, TOEFL requirements, and application details
- User-friendly contribution form for students to submit new scholarship opportunities they discover
- Mobile-responsive design for accessibility

**Admin Panel:** (Accessible via "Admin" link in navigation)
- **Username:** adminhba
- **Password:** hba2025
- Full scholarship management system
- Review and approve/reject student submissions
- Edit existing scholarship information
- Remove outdated or incorrect entries
- Secure authentication system

## Privacy & Access Control:
As you requested, this is designed as a controlled-access platform. It's not indexed by search engines and requires direct link sharing, ensuring it remains exclusive to your students rather than being discovered by thousands of applicants who might overwhelm university systems.

## Current Scholarship Database Includes:
- University of the People Afghan Women's Fund
- L.E.A.R.N. Initiative
- Shafia Fund for Afghan Women
- Qatar Scholarship for Afghans Project
- University of Toronto At-Risk Student Awards
- Türkiye Bursları Scholarship Program
- KNB Scholarship (Indonesia)

## How It Works:
1. Students can browse existing scholarships using the search and filter tools
2. When students discover new opportunities through their networks abroad, they can submit them via the contribution form
3. You receive these submissions in the admin panel for review and verification
4. Once approved, new scholarships become available to all students
5. The database grows organically through community contributions while maintaining quality control

This prototype demonstrates the full functionality you envisioned - a collaborative platform where students can share scholarship information they gather from their contacts studying abroad, while you maintain oversight to ensure accuracy and prevent outdated information.

I'd love to discuss how we can further customize this for your specific needs and potentially expand it as the program grows. The system is designed to be scalable and can easily accommodate hundreds of scholarships while remaining fast and user-friendly.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to schedule a time to walk through the platform together.

Best regards,
Tair
